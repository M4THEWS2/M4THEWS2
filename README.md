# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile!!

## About

My name's Matheus, I've been a developer since the beginning of 2020. I started learning programming to create my own games, then I found out that the world of programming is much bigger than I thought.

These are some of my skills:
- NodeJS
- Python
- C/C++

I also know a bit of HTML and CSS, but front-end isn't amongst my best skills. 

## Repositories

In the tab of my repositories you will find projects that I made for me to learn more. You are free to use the content within them as you wish.
